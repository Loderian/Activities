## Short description of Activities
Activities is a free, light-weight plugin for managing activities.
It provides an easy to use interface to manage your sites activities and who is participating.
This plugin supports multisite installations. Each site has their own activities, locations, activity archive and plugin settings.

The heart of the plugin is the Activity Report.
When using the Activity Report it is easy to manage different recurring activities like yoga courses, football training and a lot of similar group oriented activities.
The plugin integrates beautifully with WooCommerce Products.
For example, when a customer is buying participation on a yoga retreat the customer are at the same time assigned the Activity list for this particular retreat.
